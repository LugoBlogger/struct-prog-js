This book will serve as a module for a course \"Structured Programming\"
of Information System Study Program at Institut Teknologi Kalimantan.

This book is mostly inspired by \"JavaScript Definitive Guide\".
I can say that this book is very terse and hard to read but
in the end it is very rewarding.

I am also inspired by Eloquent JavaScript. This book shapes me
to find out a practical example to think about subtle concepts
of asynchronous. Thanks to the auhtor for his example of crow communication
