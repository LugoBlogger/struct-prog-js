For someone who wants to purse a career in digital world as a programmer or software developer in web application understanding about the mechanism of how the web is running is crucial. All web application is building on the three languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Only JavaScript is the programming language. The two remaining are markup language. According to 2024 Developer Survey by Stack Overflow, JavaScript is the most used programming language among the surveyed participants 1. But there is a catch. There are many contender that has better capabilities than Javascript, one of the example is TypeScript. This programming language is a superset of JavaScript. It has many intersting features like type annoations to make our code more consistent without worrying automatic type conversion when writing a program. In the far future when JavaScript will be replaced by TypeScript, we will update this book. For now, we stick to learn JavaScript. It is complicated and full of unexpected results, but when we understand that nitty-grity, we are ready to be an advanced JavaScript developer. 2.1 Structured programming Classification of structured programming compare to another paradigm. 2.2 Motivation Need for a new course plan. The students in Information Systems needs a comprehensive book that mostly cover the fundamental of web programming. 2.3 How to learn Learning to code for someone who never to code before is hard. In my short suggestion, you need to immersive yourself such that your brain will try to find a pattern how to learn. [Provide with fact about brain plasticity] You can use ChatGPT but there is a caveat. If you do not know the correct things, you will be dragged into oblivion of not knowing anything. But you can try the small things first and built on the top of it. Try to stick to the plan. If your plan does not work, try another plan. Learning programming is similar to learning arts, but you heavily used logic than your muscle. 2.4 Short tips I think this short tips are not for everyone, but this is from my experience when dealing with my students who always complain that learn programming language is difficult, boring, and not rewarding. It is never to be late to learn programming. JavaScript is not a best programming language, but pick one master it and after that you can pick another programming language with ease. (except C or the family of low-level programming language, :D) Please do not compare yourself to others, just compare yourself with your past time. Make a note, logbook, or any summary of your work or study. This will be enhance your writing skills and sharpen your mind to write something missing from the tutorial, books or any resources. Your personal notes is your spell book. https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology/#1-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
