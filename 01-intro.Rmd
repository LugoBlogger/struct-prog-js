The backbone of the webpage is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

The future of Javascript will be replaced by TypeScript?

## Structured programming

Classification of structured programming compare to another paradigm.

## Motivation 

Need for a new course plan. 
The students in Information Systems needs a comprehensive book
that mostly cover the fundamental of web programming.

## How to learn

Learning to code for someone who never to code before is hard.
In my short suggestion, you need to immersive yourself such
that your brain will try to find a pattern how to learn.

You can use ChatGPT but there is a caveat. If you do not know
the correct things, you will be dragged into oblivion of not knowing
anything. But you can try the small things first and built on the top
of it.
Try to stick to the plan. If your plan does not work, try another plan.
Learning programming is similar to learning arts, but you 
heavily used logic than your muscle.

## Short tips

I think this short tips are not for everyone, but this is from
my experience when dealing with my students who always complain
that learn programming language is difficult, boring, and not rewarding.

- It is never to be late to learn programming. JavaScript is not 
  a best programming language, but pick one master it and after
  that you can pick another programming language with ease. 
  (except C or the family of low-level programming language, :D)
- Please do not compare yourself to others, just compare yourself 
  with your past time. Make a note, logbook, or any summary of your
  work or study. This will be enhance your writing skills and
  sharpen your mind to write something missing from the tutorial, books
  or any resources. Your personal notes is your spell book.
