# Introduction 

The world is changing fast as we know that we enter a digital world 
in a quick pace. For someone who wants to purse a career in 
digital world as a programmer or software developer in web application
understanding about the mechanism of how the web is running is crucial.

All web application is building on the three languages: HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript. Only JavaScript is the programming language. The two remaining
are markup language.

According to 2024 Developer Survey by Stack Overflow, JavaScript is the most used programming language among the surveyed participants ^[https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology/#1-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages].

But there is a catch. There are many contender that has better capabilities
than Javascript, one of the example is TypeScript. This programming
language is a superset of JavaScript. It has many intersting features
like type annoations to make our code more consistent without worrying
automatic type conversion when writing a program. In the far future when
JavaScript will be replaced by TypeScript, we will update this book.
For now, we stick to learn JavaScript. It is complicated and full of 
unexpected results, but when we understand that nitty-grity, we are
ready to be an advanced JavaScript developer.


## Structured programming

Classification of structured programming compare to other paradigms
is a bit rusty. This term is first coined by the famous
Dutch computer scientist Edsger Wybe Dijkstra in his technical report
*Notes on Structured Programming*^[https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/ewd02xx/EWD249.PDF] in 1970. We found two credible books that mentioning structured
programming in [@sebesta2019] and [@gabbriellimartini2023].
According them, structured programming is a new emergent paradigm
from imperative language that used extensively GOTO statement, is changed
into the use of control structures, subroutine and block statement.
We will learn about these in the later chapter.

And also structured programming paradigm is a precusor to the object-oriented
programming language. In informal speaking they are are interchangeable, but
actually if we look at Wikipedia, there is a clear distinction between 
them as it is shown in Fig. \@ref(fig:programming-paradigm-wiki)

```{r, echo=FALSE, label="programming-paradigm-wiki", fig.cap="Structured and object-oriented programming paradigm are different families. Note: we could not find the source of this grouping, but we will try harder next time to find out", out.width='100%', fig.show='hold', fig.align="left"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/programming-paradigm-wiki.png", 1))
```

In this book, we will not explain all of the member of \"Structured programming\"
from Fig. \@ref(fig:programming-paradigm-wiki).

## The goal of this book

To fill the missing gap between web programming and basic of programming.
This book is written with the perspective of usage for the students in 
Information Systems in Indonesia. Most of them are too afraid to learn 
programming language. This book will build a brigge between that fear and confusion
to the enjoyment of learning programming.

We also published this book free of charge. Anyone can read, modify, and
give suggestion or review to this book. Any comments are welcome.

We are going to add some interactive widgets to this web version in the future.
Stay tune.


## How to learn

Learning to code for someone who never to code before is hard.
In my short suggestion, you need to immersive yourself such
that your brain will try to find a pattern how to learn. 
[Provide with fact about brain plasticity]

You can use ChatGPT but there is a caveat. If you do not know
the correct things, you will be dragged into oblivion of not knowing
anything. But you can try the small things first and built on the top
of it.
Try to stick to the plan. If your plan does not work, try another plan.
Learning programming is similar to learning arts, but you 
heavily used logic than your muscle.

## Short tips

I think this short tips are not for everyone, but this is from
my experience when dealing with my students who always complain
that learn programming language is difficult, boring, and not rewarding.

- It is never to be late to learn programming. JavaScript is not 
  a best programming language, but pick one master it and after
  that you can pick another programming language with ease. 
  (except C or the family of low-level programming language, ðŸ˜€)

- Mastering programming language takes a lot of time. 
  Be patient and enjoy the process. Eventually at the end you will acquire the skill.
  No skill happens in a single night of learning.
  
- Do not believe in genius or smart way. Believe in hard work and discipline
  in learning. Every genius or smart way is happened after a lot of exposure
  or the immersion to the materials. Do not feel so down if in the beginning
  you feel stuck and not knowing anything.
  
- The last suggestion, please do not compare yourself to others, just compare yourself 
  with your past time. I know it is easy to say than to do, but it is worth to 
  try. Make a note, logbook, or any summary of your
  work or study. This will be enhance your writing skills and
  sharpen your mind to write something missing from the tutorial, books
  or any resources. Your personal notes is your spell book. By doing that
  you can evaluate your progress and see your past history easily compare
  if you do not have any recorded activities.
