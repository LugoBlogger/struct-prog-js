This book is mostly influenced by Flanagan's book: *JavaScript - The Definitive Guide, 7th Ed*.
All the contents are intended for teaching Information System students
in ITK. But I hope it can be an introductory book for learning JavaScript
for the purpose of developing skill in web programming. There is a module 
handbook of this book where the book is developed from. You can 
access that modules in [here](https://github.com/LugoBlogger/SI-201-404-structured-programming)

To make this book, we extensively use [`bookdown`](https://bookdown.org/) 
library by Yihui Xie.
